I am a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Fellow at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering,
Alma Mater Studiorum - Università di Bologna, and also affiliated with the INRIA OLAS Team.

I study mathematical foundations of computation, through an algebraic lens.
My research spans programming languages, type theory, category theory,
logic, semantics, constructive mathematics, and formalisation.
