abstract: |
  This work is about using directional logic programming to give foundations to
  mode-correct bidirectional type systems [2, \S 6.2]. Reddy[5] uses a term
  language for classical linear logic, adapted from Abramsky's Linear Chemical
  Abstract Machine (LCHAM) [1], to give a typed calculus for directional logic
  programs. We give a categorical semantics to Reddy's calculus, using
  polycategories. We give normalisation results for this calculus, which shows how
  to evaluate logic queries to normal forms, that gives output substitutions
  indicating whether queries fail or succeed.
