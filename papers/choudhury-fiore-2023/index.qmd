  We develop a constructive theory of finite multisets in Homotopy Type Theory,
  defining them as free commutative monoids. After recalling basic structural
  properties of the free commutative-monoid construction, we formalise and
  establish the categorical universal property of two, necessarily equivalent,
  algebraic presentations of free commutative monoids using 1-HITs. These
  presentations correspond to two different equational theories invariably
  including commutation axioms. In this setting, we prove important structural
  combinatorial properties of finite multisets. These properties are established
  in full generality without assuming decidable equality on the carrier set. As an
  application, we present a constructive formalisation of the relational model of
  classical linear logic and its differential structure. This leads to
  constructively establishing that free commutative monoids are conical refinement
  monoids. Thereon we obtain a characterisation of the equality type of finite
  multisets and a new presentation of the free commutative-monoid construction as
  a set-quotient of the list construction. These developments crucially rely on
  the commutation relation of creation/annihilation operators associated with the
  free commutative-monoid construction seen as a combinatorial Fock space.
