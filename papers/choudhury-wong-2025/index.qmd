abstract: |
  Sorting algorithms are fundamental to computer science, and their correctness
  criteria are well understood as rearranging elements of a list according to a
  specified total order on the underlying set of elements. As mathematical
  functions, they are functions on lists that perform combinatorial operations on
  the representation of the input list. In this paper, we study sorting algorithms
  conceptually as abstract sorting functions.  There is a canonical surjection
  from the free monoid on a set (lists of elements) to the free commutative monoid
  on the same set (multisets of elements). We show that sorting functions
  determine a section (right inverse) to this surjection satisfying two axioms,
  that do not presuppose a total order on the underlying set. Then, we establish
  an equivalence between (decidable) total orders on the underlying set and
  correct sorting functions.  The first part of the paper develops concepts from
  universal algebra from the point of view of functorial signatures, and gives
  constructions of free monoids and free commutative monoids in (univalent) type
  theory. Using these constructions, the second part of the paper develops the
  axiomatisation of sorting functions. The paper uses informal mathematical
  language, and comes with an accompanying formalisation in Cubical Agda.
