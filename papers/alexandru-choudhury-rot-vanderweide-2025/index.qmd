  The paper "Sorting with Bialgebras and Distributive Laws" by Hinze et al. uses
  the framework of bialgebraic semantics to define sorting algorithms. From
  distributive laws between functors they construct pairs of sorting algorithms
  using both folds and unfolds. Pairs of sorting algorithms arising this way
  include insertion/selection sort and quick/tree sort. We extend this work to
  define intrinsically correct variants in cubical Agda. Our key idea is to index
  our data types by multisets, which concisely captures that a sorting algorithm
  terminates with an ordered permutation of its input list. By lifting bialgebraic
  semantics to the indexed setting, we obtain the correctness of sorting
  algorithms purely from the distributive law.
