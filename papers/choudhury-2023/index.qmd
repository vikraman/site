  This thesis studies various logics and programming languages for
  resource-conscious computation, in particular, their syntax, categorical and
  denotational semantics, and presents a collection of results. Firstly, we study
  the construction of free commutative monoids in univalent type theory, and their
  structural combinatorial properties. We give a formal construction of the
  relational model of classical linear logic, and use free commutative monoids to
  construct the comonadic exponential modality. Relating this to the combinatorial
  Fock space construction and associated creation/annihilation operators, we
  exhibit the differential structure of this relation model. From this, we derive
  a commutation relation characterising the path space of free commutative
  monoids. Secondly, we groupoidify and study free symmetric monoidal groupoids
  and free symmetric rig groupoids. These are used to build a family of high-level
  programming languages for reversible computing, giving them an equational theory
  stemming from the categorical coherence conditions. We then give a denotational
  semantics to this family of languages, using deloopings of symmetric groups, and
  obtain a fully-complete denotational semantics using the groupoid of finite sets
  and bijections, with its additive and multiplicative monoidal structure. This
  establishes a Curry-Howard-Lambek correspondence for reversible computing with
  finite number of bits. We show some applications of this semantics to perform
  normalisation-by-evaluation, verification, and synthesis of reversible boolean
  circuits, motivated by examples from quantum computing. Thirdly, we study
  capability-safe programming, using an effectful simply-typed lambda calculus. We
  give a denotational semantics to this language by building a capability-space
  model, which formalises the notion of capability-safety. We identify its
  axiomatic categorical structure and use this to justify the equational theory of
  the language. Using this semantics, we construct a comonadic modality expressing
  capability denial, and use it to extend the syntax of our language. We show that
  this modality allows one to recover pure computation in an otherwise impure
  language.
