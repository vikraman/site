abstract: |
  We establish a close connection between a reversible programming language based
  on type isomorphisms and a formally presented univalent universe. The
  correspondence relates combinators witnessing type isomorphisms in the
  programming language to paths in the univalent universe; and combinator
  optimizations in the programming language to 2-paths in the univalent universe.
  The result suggests a simple computational interpretation of paths and of
  univalence in terms of familiar programming constructs whenever the universe in
  question is computable.
