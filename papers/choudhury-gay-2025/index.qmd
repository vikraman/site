  In this paper, we develop and study the following perspective -- just as
  higher-order functions give exponentials, higher-order continuations give
  coexponentials. From this, we design a language that combines exponentials and
  coexponentials, producing a duality of lambda abstraction.

  We formalise this language by giving an extension of a call-by-value
  simply-typed lambda-calculus with covalues, coabstraction, and coapplication. We
  develop the semantics of this language using the axiomatic structure of
  continuations, which we use to produce an equational theory, that gives a
  complete axiomatisation of control effects. We give a computational
  interpretation to this language using speculative execution and backtracking,
  and use this to derive the classical control operators and computational
  interpretation of classical logic, and encode common patterns of control flow
  using continuations. By dualising functional completeness, we further develop
  duals of first-order arrow languages using coexponentials. Finally, we discuss
  the implementation of this duality as control operators in programming, and
  develop some applications.
