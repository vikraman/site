abstract: |
  Multiparty Session Types (MPSTs) offer a structured way of specifying
  communication protocols and guarantee relevant communication properties, such as
  deadlock-freedom. In this paper, we extend a minimal MPST system with quantum
  data and operations, enabling the specification of quantum protocols. Quantum
  MPSTs (QMPSTs) provide a formal notation to describe quantum protocols, both at
  the abstract level of global types, describing which communications can take
  place in the system and their dependencies, and at the concrete level of local
  types and quantum processes, describing the expected behavior of each
  participant in the protocol. Type-checking relates these two levels formally,
  ensuring that processes behave as prescribed by the global type. Beyond usual
  communication properties, QMPSTs also allow us to prove that qubits are owned by
  a single process at any time, capturing the quantum no-cloning and no-deleting
  theorems. We use our approach to verify four quantum protocols from the
  literature, respectively Teleportation, Secret Sharing, Bit-Commitment, and Key
  Distribution.
