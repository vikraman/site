  In this talk, we study free monoids, free commutative monoids, and their
  connections with sorting and well-orders. Univalent type theory provides a
  rigorous framework for implementing these ideas, in the construction of free
  algebras using higher inductive types and quotients, and reasoning up to
  equivalence using categorical universal properties. The main contributions are a
  new framework for universal algebra (free algebras and their universal
  properties), various constructions of free monoids and free commutative monoids
  (with proofs of their universal properties), applications to proving
  combinatorial properties of these constructions, and finally an axiomatic
  understanding of sorting. Our results have been formalized in Cubical Agda, and
  the formalization is available at:
