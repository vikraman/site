abstract: |
  Multiparty Session Types (MPSTs) are a typing discipline for message-passing
  protocols that guarantee communication safety properties, such as
  deadlock-freedom. We propose a quantum extension of MPSTs, called Quantum MPSTs
  (QMPSTs), with the aim of specifying quantum protocols. QMPSTs guarantee usual
  communication safety properties, in addition to safety properties specific to
  quantum information, such as no-cloning and no-deleting. We exhibit the use of
  QMP-STs to verify Quantum Teleportation. The full paper (to appear in SEFM'24
  proceedings) with complete details, metatheoretic results, and examples of other
  quantum protocols is available at arXiv:2409.11133 [Lanese et al. 2024].
