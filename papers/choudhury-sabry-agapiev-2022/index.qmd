abstract: |
  We advance the thesis that the simulation of quantum circuits is fundamentally
  about the efficient management of a large (potentially exponential) number of
  delimited continuations. The family of Scheme languages, with its efficient
  implementations of first-class continuations and with its imperative constructs,
  provides an elegant host for modeling and simulating quantum circuits.
