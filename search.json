From this, we design\n    a language that combines exponentials and coexponentials, producing\n    a duality of lambda abstraction. We formalise this language by\n    giving an extension of a call-by-value simply-typed lambda-calculus\n    with covalues, coabstraction, and coapplication. We develop the\n    semantics of this language using the axiomatic structure of\n    continuations, which we use to produce an equational theory, that\n    gives a complete axiomatisation of control effects. We give a\n    computational interpretation to this language using speculative\n    execution and backtracking, and use this to derive the classical\n    control operators and computational interpretation of classical\n    logic, and encode common patterns of control flow using\n    continuations. By dualising functional completeness, we further\n    develop duals of first-order arrow languages using coexponentials.\n    Finally, we discuss the implementation of this duality as control\n    operators in programming, and develop some applications.}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nChoudhury, Vikraman, and Simon J.

Our key observation is\n    that, just as the pure simply-typed lambda calculus can be extended\n    to support effects with a monadic type discipline, an impure typed\n    lambda calculus can be extended to support purity with a comonadic\n    type discipline. We establish the correctness of our type system via\n    a simple denotational model, which we call the capability space\n    model. Our model formalises the intuition common to systems\n    programmers that the ability to perform effects should be controlled\n    via access to a permission or capability, and that a program is\n    capability-safe if it performs no effects that it does not have a\n    runtime capability for. We then identify the axiomatic categorical\n    structure that the capability space model validates, and use these\n    axioms to give a categorical semantics for our comonadic type\n    system. We then give an equational theory (substitution and the\n    call-by-value β and η laws) for the imperative lambda calculus, and\n    show its soundness relative to this semantics. Finally, we give a\n    translation of the pure simply-typed lambda calculus into our\n    comonadic imperative calculus, and show that any two terms which are\n    βη-equal in the STLC are equal in the equational theory of the\n    comonadic calculus, establishing that pure programs can be mapped in\n    an equation-preserving way into our imperative calculus.}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nChoudhury, Vikraman, and Neel Krishnaswami. 2020. “Recovering\nPurity with Comonads and Capabilities.” In Proceedings of the\nACM on Programming Languages. https://doi.org/10.1145/3408993."

The key idea is to reflect\n    the code implementing a user-defined function into the function’s\n    (output) refinement type. As a consequence, at uses of the function,\n    the function definition is instantiated in the SMT logic in a\n    precise fashion that permits decidable verification. Reflection\n    allows the user to write equational proofs of programs just by\n    writing other programs using pattern-matching and recursion to\n    perform case-splitting and induction. Thus, via the\n    propositions-as-types principle, we show that reflection permits the\n    specification of arbitrary functional correctness properties.\n    Finally, we introduce a proof-search algorithm called Proof by\n    Logical Evaluation that uses techniques from model checking and\n    abstract interpretation, to completely automate equational\n    reasoning.

The reversible causal-consistent debugging and replay (RCCDR) approach allows a faulty execution in the production environment to be logged and replayed in a reversible debugger. This enables researchers to explore the logged execution backwards and forwards, tracing the issue back to its cause. However, RCCDR requires full access to the source code of the target programme. To overcome this limitation, the project will seek to adapt RCCDR for use with partially accessible systems. The concept will be investigated both abstractly and concretely. Project outcomes could expand RCCDR applicability, benefiting small- and medium-sized IT enterprises and software developers."

Pairs of sorting algorithms arising this way include\n    insertion/selection sort and quick/tree sort. We extend this work to\n    define intrinsically correct variants in cubical Agda. Our key idea\n    is to index our data types by multisets, which concisely captures\n    that a sorting algorithm terminates with an ordered permutation of\n    its input list. By lifting bialgebraic semantics to the indexed\n    setting, we obtain the correctness of sorting algorithms purely from\n    the distributive law.}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nAlexandru, Cass, Vikraman Choudhury, Jurriaan Rot, and Niels van der\nWeide. 2025. “Intrinsically Correct Sorting in Cubical\nAgda.” In Certified Programs and Proofs. https://doi.org/10.1145/3703595.3705873."

In this setting, we prove\n    important structural combinatorial properties of finite multisets.\n    These properties are established in full generality without assuming\n    decidable equality on the carrier set. As an application, we present\n    a constructive formalisation of the relational model of classical\n    linear logic and its differential structure. This leads to\n    constructively establishing that free commutative monoids are\n    conical refinement monoids. Thereon we obtain a characterisation of\n    the equality type of finite multisets and a new presentation of the\n    free commutative-monoid construction as a set-quotient of the list\n    construction. These developments crucially rely on the commutation\n    relation of creation/annihilation operators associated with the free\n    commutative-monoid construction seen as a combinatorial Fock space.}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nChoudhury, Vikraman, and Marcelo Fiore. 2023. “Free Commutative\nMonoids in Homotopy Type Theory.” In Electronic Notes in\nTheoretical Informatics and Computer Science. https://doi.org/10.46298/entics.10492."

The main contributions are a new\n    framework for universal algebra (free algebras and their universal\n    properties), various constructions of free monoids and free\n    commutative monoids (with proofs of their universal properties),\n    applications to proving combinatorial properties of these\n    constructions, and finally an axiomatic understanding of sorting.\n    Our results have been formalized in Cubical Agda, and the\n    formalization is available at:\n    https://github.com/pufferffish/agda-symmetries/.}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nWong, Wind, Vikraman Choudhury, and Simon J Gay. 2024. “On\nCommutativity, Total Orders, and Sorting.” In Workshop on\nHomotopy Type Theory / Univalent Foundations (HoTT/UF 2024). https://site.vikraman.org/papers/wong-choudhury-gay-2024/."
