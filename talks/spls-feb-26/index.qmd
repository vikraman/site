## What does a debugger do?

- Reversible debuggers record the trace of a program's execution
- In debugging mode, the user can step forward and backward through the trace
- The user can inspect the state of the program at any point in the trace, and look at the events that led to a particular state
- What if the program is concurrent?
- In a concurrent program, the trace is not linear, but a partial order of events
- To step backwards, the debugger needs to know which events are causally related, and which are independent
