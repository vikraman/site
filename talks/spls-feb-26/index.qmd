## What does a debugger do?

- Reversible debuggers record the trace of a program's execution
- In debugging mode, the user can step forward and backward through the trace
- The user can inspect the state of the program at any point in the trace, and look at the events that led to a particular state
- What if the program is concurrent?
- In a concurrent program, the trace is not linear, but a partial order of events
- To step backwards, the debugger needs to know which events are causally related, and which are independent

## Example: 1

::: {.imagify}
\begin{tikzpicture} [draw=cyan!70!black,
    node distance = 10em,
    on grid,
    auto,
    every loop/.style={stealth-}]

% State c0
\node (c0) [state,
    initial,
    accepting,
    initial text = {}] {$c_0$};

% State c1
\node (c1) [state,
    right = of c0] {$c_1$};

% State c2
\node (c2) [state,
    right = of c1] {$c_2$};

% Arrows
\path [-stealth, thick]
    (c0) edge[bend left] node {$e_1$}   (c1)
    (c1) edge[bend left] node {$e_2$}   (c2)
    (c1) edge[bend left] node {$e_1'$}  (c0)
    (c2) edge[bend left] node {$e_2'$}  (c1);
\end{tikzpicture}

## Event Structures

An event structure is a:

- partial order of events $(E, \leq)$, satisfying
  - axiom of finite causes: $\downset{e} = \{e' \in E \mid e' \leq e\}$ is finite for all $e \in E$, and
- a conflict relation ${\confl} \subseteq E \times E$, that is:
  - irreflexive and symmetric, and satisfies
  - axiom of hereditary conflict: if $e \confl e'$ and $e' \leq e''$, then $e \confl e''$.

::: footer
This is a prime event structure with binary conflict.
