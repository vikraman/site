Hello! I am a graduate student
at [Indiana University Bloomington](https://indiana.edu/), advised
by [Amr Sabry](https://www.cs.indiana.edu/~sabry/). I study **higher
type theory** and **logic**. I also work on some Haskell projects
with [Ryan Newton](https://www.cs.indiana.edu/~rrnewton/).

Sometimes I also wear a

hat.
