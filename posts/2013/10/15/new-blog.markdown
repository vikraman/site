I have a shiny new statically generated blog now. It is powered by
[Hakyll](http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll). The source code for the site is
available on [github](https://github.com/vikraman).

I was able to migrate most of my
[old wordpress posts](https://vh4x0r.wordpress.com) using
[this handy script](https://github.com/mloskot/exitwp). I am not sure
whether to setup comments on this blog, since most of the comments on
the old blog turned out to be spam. If you really feel the need to
discuss stuff related to any of my posts, please
[get in touch](http://vikraman.org/contact.html) the old-fashioned
way.

Although my blogging activity has been terribly irregular, I will try
to be more active now.
