I was recently able to abuse git and github to create [this](https://github.com/torvalds/linux-ng).
The repository reached 100+ stars in minutes and hit the [hackernews frontpage](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6827029).
In retrospect, I shouldn't have exploited it before reporting, so apologies if I have offended anyone.

_Update_: It seems github is reluctant to fix this.
