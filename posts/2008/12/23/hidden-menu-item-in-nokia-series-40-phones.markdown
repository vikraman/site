I just discovered a hidden menu item in my nokia 3110c phone; the trick also works in the Nokia S40 SDK emulator.  


  1. Go to Calendar
  2. Select "Options" -> "Go to to-do list"
  3. Select "Back" -> "Back"
Now you reach a hidden menu called "My files" that contains "Gallery", "Media" and "Organiser". What is interesting is that the three items are numbered 1,3 and 4! Sounds like a perfect Easter egg!
