There has been a damage to undersea cables linking Europe and Asia on 19th December, resulting in disruption of internet traffic in the Middle East and several parts of Asia, as pointed out by [Amit Agarwal](http://www.labnol.org/internet/internet-disrupted-as-undersea-cables-cut-again/6146/). India has been particularly affected. I have been experiencing reduced access speeds on my TATA Indicom broadband connection, and I came to know the truth today (even the customer care guy couldn't tell!).
