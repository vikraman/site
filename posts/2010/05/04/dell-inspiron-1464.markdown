Well, I bought a new Dell Inspiron 1464, and my old HP Pavilion is out for sale. It came with Windows 7 Home Basic, which I won't use, so I declined the EULA at the first bootup, and have applied to Dell for a Windows refund. I'm currently busy experimenting , and am bootstrapping gentoo on it ! Will report back on my progress ^_^
