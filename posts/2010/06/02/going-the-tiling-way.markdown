I have never tried a tiling window manager before, and I thought of giving it a go ! Now, for the past few days, I'm hooked to xmonad and dwm. I first tried dwm, hacking on the config.h file, and loved it right away ! Then I moved on to awesome, i3, wmii and so on... Then came xmonad, which is my favourite ! I have been on [haskell.org](http://www.haskell.org) for the past few days (it was down for some hours though :-( ), and I did learn a lot. Thanks to [serverninja](http://github.com/serverninja/) for his xmonad.hs. I'll make a dotfiles repository of mine on github soon with my shiny new xmonad.hs ;-)
