Hi everyone,

This is my third weekly report on the progress of my GSoC project.

Progress during the last week:



	
  * Created mockups for the WebUI

	
  * Reworked the server code to be modular

	
  * Wrote a page to display per host statistics

	
  * Wrote a setup.py script to install the client

	
  * Deployed the webapp locally using mod_wsgi


Issues:

	
  * Blocked on [bug 369679](http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=369679) to deploy the webapp


Goals for next week(s):

	
  * Write ebuilds for the client/server

	
  * Continue writing the stats pages based on the mockups

	
  * Write some tests for the client
