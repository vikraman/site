Finally my semester exams have come to an end, and I'm back to coding for my GSoC project. Some plans that I have in mind for the upcoming days are :






  * Rework the client code using equery and enalyze modules from gentoolkit


  * Add more fields, using the keys in portage.settings


  * Improve the user authentication mechanism




The shell account on [soc.dev.gentoo.org](http://soc.dev.gentoo.org) is now available, thanks to robbat2 ! We'll soon be deploying the webapp on the server once the dependency packages are installed.
