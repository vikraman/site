Hello people,

The [package statistics project](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/project/google/gsoc2011/vh4x0r/26001) is alive and in progress. Over the last weeks, I worked on the following:



	
  * gentoostats-cli : A cli interface to the gentoostats webapp.Â You can do operations like :




	
    * gentoostats-cli list repo

	
    * gentoostats-cli list package --category=sys-devel --package=gcc

	
    * gentoostats-cli search --package=python --min_hosts=10


	
  * Better pages for the webUI, adding forms for package search etc.


I'm pretty much approaching the end of my project, and need some more ideas/feature suggestions. Some feedback would be helpful.

Some stuff I have in mind for the next few days:

	
  * Packages/Users vs Categories/Packages plots

	
  * Testing against various security risks

	
  * An ebuild for the server
