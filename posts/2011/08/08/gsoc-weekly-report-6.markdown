Hi everyone,

Over the past weeks, I worked on adding a json api to [packages.gentoo.org](http://packages.gentoo.org), to access all packages in the portage tree. The patches are ready, but not yet deployed.

Currently I'm working on a cli client for the [gentoostats webapp](https://soc.dev.gentoo.org/gentoostats/). It should basically provide all the functionality of the webapp (refer to [midterm report](http://vh4x0r.wordpress.com/2011/07/14/gsoc-midterm-report/)).
