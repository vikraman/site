As dire chance and fateful cockup would have it, I've been attacked by the Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV) and have contracted Varicella disease (ChickenPox). So much for my semester exams, applying to GSoC, and India's World Cup win celebration ! I'm utterly depressed, besides having to take 5*800mg shots of 2-amino-9-((2-hydroxyethoxy)methyl)-1H-purin-6(9H)-one (Aciclovir).
