The big results have finally arrived, and I'm in! Yeah, that's right, I've been selected to Google Summer of Code 2011, for my project with Gentoo. Thanks to all admins, mentors from my community who reviewed and accepted my proposal. Out of the top of my head, I would like to thank dberkholz, antarus, dol-sen, sping, a3li, Serkan for their helpful comments and enlightening ideas. Also many thanks to Google for accepting me. Looking forward to a great experience with Summer of Code in the upcoming months ^_^
